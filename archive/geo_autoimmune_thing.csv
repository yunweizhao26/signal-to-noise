1,GSE127969,Single-cell RNA-seq in monozygotic twins discordant for multiple sclerosis,multiple sclerosis,,,127969,"Here we investigated the earliest possible evidence of subclinical neuro-inflammation (SCNI) using a small cohort of monozygotic twins where one sibling had clinically definite MS and the other been clinically ""healthy"" but has a maximal genetic for developing MS. In contrast to subjects with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), our group of very early SCNI does not even fulfill the (arbitrary) MRI criteria for RIS but have more subtle MRI changes and/or evidence of neuro-inflammation in the CSF, e.g. oligoclonal bands (OCBs). For analyzing CSF samples from Twin pairs and controls in greater detail we applied single-cell whole transcriptome sequencing (scRNAseq). Our findings demonstrate that even the earliest experimentally approachable stage of MS is characterized by synergistic activation of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and B cells."
2,GSE221704,RANK+TLR2+ Myeloid Subpopulation Converts Autoimmune to Joint Destruction in Rheumatoid Arthritis,rheumatoid arthritis,,,221704,"Joint destruction is the major clinic burden in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear, though, how this autoimmune disease progresses to the point of deterioration of the joint. Here, we report that in a mouse model of RA the upregulation of TLR2 expression and its a(2,3) sialylation in RANK+ myeloid monocytes mediate the transition from autoimmunity to osteoclast fusion and bone resorption, resulting in joint destruction. The expression of a(2,3) sialyltransferases were significantly increased in RANK+TLR2+ myeloid monocytes, and their inhibition or treatment with a TLR2 inhibitor blocked osteoclast fusion. Notably, analysis of our single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) libraries generated from RA mice revealed a novel RANK+TLR2- subset that negatively regulated osteoclast fusion. Importantly, the RANK+TLR2+ subset was significantly diminished with the treatments. Moreover, the RANK+TLR2- subset could differentiate into a TRAP+ osteoclast lineage, but the resulting cells did not fuse to form osteoclasts. Our scRNA-seq data showed that Maf is highly expressed in the RANK+TLR2- subset, and the a(2,3) sialyltransferase inhibitor induced Maf expression in the RANK+TLR2+ subset. The identification of a RANK+TLR2- subset provides a potential explanation for TRAP+ mononuclear cells in bone and their anabolic activity. Further, TLR2 expression and its a(2,3) sialylation in the RANK+ myeloid monocytes could be effective targets to prevent autoimmune-mediated joint destruction."

11,GSE174188,Multiplexed scRNA-seq reveals the cellular and genetic correlates of systemic lupus erythematosus,systemic lupus erythematosus,,,174188,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Knowledge of circulating immune cell types and cell states associated with SLE remains incomplete. We profiled over 1.2 million PBMCs (162 cases, 99 controls) with multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq (mux-seq). Cases exhibited prominent expression of type-1 interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) in monocytes, reduction of naïve CD4+ T cells that correlated with monocyte ISG expression, and expansion of repertoire-restricted cytotoxic GZMH+ CD8+ T cells. Cell-type-specific expression features accurately predicted case-control status and stratified patients into two molecular subtypes. We integrated dense genotyping data, mapping cell-type-specific cis-eQTLs and linked known and novel SLE-associated variants to cell-type-specific gene expression. These results demonstrate mux-seq as a systematic approach to characterize cellular composition, identify transcriptional signatures, and annotate genetic variants associated with SLE."

A better understanding of how these iatrogenic diseases compare to naturally arising autoimmune diseases is needed for treatment and monitoring of irAEs. We identified differences in anti-PD-1-induced Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and spontaneous T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by performing single-cell RNA-seq and TCR-seq on T cells from the pancreas, pancreas-draining lymph node (pLN), and blood of mice with PD-1-induced T1D or spontaneous T1D. In the pancreas, anti-PD-1 resulted in expansion of terminally-exhausted/effector-like CD8+ T cells, an increase in T-bethi CD4+FoxP3- T cells, and a decrease in memory CD4+FoxP3- and CD8+ T cells in contrast to spontaneous T1D. Notably, anti-PD-1 caused increased TCR sharing between the pancreas and the periphery. Moreover, T cells in the blood of anti-PD-1-treated mice expressed markers that differed from spontaneous T1D, suggesting that the blood may provide a window to monitor irAEs rather than relying exclusively on the autoimmune target organ."
17,GSE212009,Heterogeneity of islet-infiltrating interleukin-21+ CD4 T cells in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes,type 1 diabetes,,,212009,"Interleukin (IL)-21 is essential for type 1 diabetes (T1D) development in the NOD mouse model. IL-21-expressing CD4 T cells are present in pancreatic islets where they contribute to disease progression. However, little is known about their phenotype and differentiation states. To fill this gap, we generated a novel IL-21 reporter NOD strain to further characterize IL-21+ CD4 T cells in T1D. IL-21+ CD4 T cells accumulate in pancreatic islets and recognize β-cell antigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that most CD4 T effector cells in islets actively express IL-21 and they are highly diabetogenic despite expressing multiple inhibitory molecules, including PD-1 and LAG3. Islet IL-21+ CD4 T cells segregate into four phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct differentiation states, less differentiated early effectors, Tfh-like cells, and two Th1 subsets. Trajectory analysis predicts that early effectors differentiate into both Tfh-like and terminal Th1 cells. We further demonstrated that intrinsic IL-27 signaling controls the differentiation of islet IL-21+ CD4 T cells, contributing to their helper function. Collectively, our study reveals the heterogeneity of islet-infiltrating IL-21+ CD4 T cells and indicates that both Tfh-like and Th1 subsets continuously produce IL-21 throughout their differentiation process, highlighting the important sources of IL-21 in T1D pathogenesis."

19,GSE255303,Ctla-4 deficiency induces an inflammatory bowel disease-like phenotype in a zebrafish model [scRNA-seq],inflammatory bowel disease,,,255303,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 ortholog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibit reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, these findings offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a new model for investigating pathogenesis and potential treatments."

Understanding how unique and common dysregulation of the innate and adaptive lymphocytes contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis is crucial for development of novel and efficient therapies.  Methods: We used flow cytometry to extensively characterize ILCs in pediatric (p)IBD patients (n=12) and controls (n=9), as well as single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the heterogeneity and inflammation-specific imprinting of ILCs, NK cells and T cells (n=6). Key findings were extended to adult IBD colonic mucosa (n=8) using flow cytometry.   Results: We report a dysregulated mucosal ILC composition in pIBD that correlates to inflammatory activity. ILCs show pronounced and unique transcriptional changes in inflammation, particularly those related to antigen-presentation, while several interferon-associated transcripts are upregulated across lymphocyte lineages in inflammation. Furthermore, we identify two transcriptionally distinct T cell subsets, which are dysregulated in inflammation. This includes a subset transcribing KLRF1 and other NK-associated transcripts, that were enriched in inflamed pIBD mucosa. A corresponding NK-like NKp80+ T cell population, expressing high levels of NK cell receptors and cytotoxic molecules, are also accumulated in adult IBD.   Conclusions: Using a combination of high-dimensional single-cell analysis on the transcriptional and protein level, we provide a comprehensive characterization of ILCs and T cells in pediatric and adult IBD. Our findings contribute to increased mechanistic understanding of intestinal inflammation and identify promising targets for IBD therapy, including the NK cell receptor NKp80.  "
21,GSE231728,Celastrol targets LRP1 to inhibit fibroblast-macrophage crosstalk and ameliorates psoriasis progression,psoriasis,,,231728,"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the mechanism of Celastrol in improving psoriasis through single-cell transcriptomics Methods: Supplementation with intragastric administration of celastrol in C57BL/6 mice to observe its effect on IMQ-induced psoriasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing were performed to explore the role of celastrol for IMQ-induced psoriasis. Results: A natural product library was used to screen for a small molecule compound, celastrol, that could interfere with fibroblast-macrophage communication. It was demonstrated that celastrol targeted low-denisity lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) to inhibit fibroblast secretion of CCL2 and inhibited psoriasis progression by reducing its recruitment to macrophages, thereby blocking communication between the two cells Conclusion: We report that celastrol targeted low-denisity lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) to inhibit fibroblast secretion of CCL2 and inhibited psoriasis progression by reducing its recruitment to macrophages. The use of celastrol maybe a noveltherapeuticoption for psoriasis."

Methods: Supplementation with smear administration of SBM in the imiquimod-induced murine model, record the weight change and psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score during the whole process. Using hematoxylin-eosin staining to obverse to skin structure. Performing single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the mechanism of SBM in influencing psoriasis-like phenotype. Immunofluorescence were conducted for verification. Results: SBM remarkably alleviated the psoriasis-like phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis shown the expression of Il17 and Il23 was diminished in keratinocytes and T cells, accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of Th17 cells. Meanwhile, endothelial cell activation was inhibited along with the expression of Cxcl16. Conclusion: In this work, we found that natural product SBM inhibited the IL-23/Th17 axis and CXCL16-mediated endothelial activation and had a good therapeutic effect on psoriasis in mice model. This work suggests the potential therapeutic value of SBM in psoriatic patients."
23,GSE220116,Single-cell transcriptomics suggest distinct upstream drivers of IL-17A/F in hidradenitis versus psoriasis,psoriasis,,,220116,"Background: Based on the mounting evidence that Type 17 T-cells (T17 cells) and increased IL-17 play a key role in driving hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) lesion development, biologics previously used in psoriasis that block signaling of IL-17A and/or IL-17F isoforms have been repurposed to treat HS. Objective: Our aim was to characterize the transcriptome of HS T17 cells compared to the transcriptome of psoriasis T17 cells, and their ligand-receptor interactions with neighborhood immune cell subsets. Methods: Single-cell data of 12,300 cutaneous immune cells from 8 de-roofing surgical HS skin samples that included dermal tunnels were compared with single-cell data of psoriasis skin (19,525 cells from 11 samples) and control skin (11,920 cells from 10 samples). All the single-cell data were generated by the identical protocol. Results: HS T17 cells expressed lower levels of IL23R and higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis T17 cells (p < 0.05). HS regulatory T-cells (Tregs) expressed higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis Tregs (p < 0.05). Semimature dendritic cells (DCs) were the major immune cell subsets expressing IL1B in HS, and IL-1B ligand-receptor interactions between semimature DCs and T17 cells were increased in HS compared to psoriasis (p < 0.05). HS dermal tunnel keratinocytes (KCs) expressed inflammatory cytokines (IL17C, IL1A, IL1B, and IL6) different from HS epidermis KCs (IL36G) (p < 0.05). IL6, which synergizes with IL1B to maintain cytokine expression in T17 cells, was mainly expressed by fibroblasts in HS, which also expressed IL11+ inflammatory fibroblast genes (IL11, IL24, IL6, and POSTN) involved in paracrine IL-1/IL-6 loop. Conclusion: The IL-1B-T17 cell cytokine axis is likely a dominant pathway in HS with HS T17 cells activated by IL-1B signaling, unlike psoriasis T17 cells which are activated by IL-23 signaling. Clinical Implication: Biologics targeting IL-17 isoforms and IL-1B may be effective for HS but biologics targeting IL-23 may be less effective for HS."

However, transcriptomic profiles of skin lesions have not been performed thus far. Here, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in a patient with COVID-19 infection with a maculopapular skin rash while on treatment with the interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 blocker ustekinumab for underlying psoriasis. Results were compared with healthy controls and untreated psoriasis. We found the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in keratinocytes of the patient with COVID-19, while ACE2 expression was low to undetectable in psoriasis lesions and healthy skin. Among all cell types, ACE2+ keratinocyte clusters showed the highest levels of transcriptomic dysregulation in COVID-19, expressing type 1–associated immune markers such as CXCL9 and CXCL10. In line with a generally type 1–skewed immune microenvironment, cytotoxic lymphocytes showed increased expression of the IFNG gene and other T-cell effector genes, while type 2, type 17, or type 22 T-cell activation was largely absent. Conversely, downregulation of several anti-inflammatory mediators was observed. This first transcriptomic description of a COVID-19-associated rash identifies ACE2+ keratinocytes displaying profound transcriptional changes, and inflammatory immune cells that might help to improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2-associated skin conditions."

We have overcome these obstacles by harvesting inflammatory cells emigrating from a half of 6 mm punch biopsy skin after 48-hour incubation in culture medium without any enzyme, and then analyzing the harvested cells with single-cell RNA sequencing. By this strategy, we obtained single-cell RNA sequencing data of 24,354 cells (leukocytes 46.0%, keratinocytes 49.6%, and melanocytes 2.4%) from 13 human psoriasis skin and 5 healthy volunteer skin. Unsupervised clustering identified NK cells, CD161+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, regulatory T-cells, mature & semimature dendritic cells, melanocytes, and keratinocytes in different layers - S.

However, the seronegative MG patient subgroup, which accounts for about 15% of MG patients, remains challenging diagnosis, and the immunopathology is understudied. Therefore, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis by peripheral blood and plasma proteome analysis for the seronegative MG patients. Numerical abnormalities were observed in multiple immune cells including B-cells compared to healthy controls (HC) and correlated with disease activities. Additionally, plasma protein of CD22 that was reported to be expressed in the lineage of B-cell maturation, such as mature B-cells and memory B-cells was decreased compared to HC, and had correlation with disease severity, B-cells frequency, and the RNA expression level. These results suggest that the seronegative MG patients have immune disorders centered on B-cells.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled 32529 pDCs enriched and T cell depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 patients with SSc and 4 matched controls. Increased CD16+ monocytes and decreased cDCs are the major changes in the cell composition between SSc and heathy controls. Increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and apoptotic genes distinguished cells from patients with SSc from healthy control cells. The high ISG expression signature (ISGhi) derived from a small number of transcriptionally defined subpopulations within major cell types, including monocytes, natural killer cells, conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, B cells. Profiling of 10976 pDCs revealed a newly identified PTGDS+ population and a clear increased ISG hi clusters in SSc pDCs. Profiling of 13317 Monocytes revealed increased CD16+ Monocytes and a clear increased ISG hi clusters in SSc monocytes. We then compared the TLRs-IFN response of the pDCs from SSc and Healthy control. RNASeq revealed SSc pDCs enables an unexpected TLR8-IFN signaling to increase the IFN signature. This study lays the groundwork for resolving the origin of the SSc transcriptional signatures and the disease heterogeneity towards precision medicine applications."
